## DEPRECATION NOTICE

Well, sorta, kinda. Google got really good at figuring out when a query is coming from
a bot, so at the last party it banned the bot rather fast.

Until the WWW::Google::Time plugin can be replaced with some API
(does google even have a Time API?) or something else that works, this module is
basically trash.
